# HW_5_Workday_Scheduler
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. 

## Framework Used

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery


## Installation

1. I started the project by pseudo coding. This way I created a strategy on how to tackle the creation of the planner.

2. First I created the HTML. It includes the header, the title of the site,and the form planner on the body.

3. Second, I created the css to style the page. 

4. Next I used jQuery to power the planner. 

5. Used moment.js to get the times and dates.

6. Created a function for the planner to be cleared the next day.

7. Populated each row with the times and made them am and pm.

8. Used local storage to enable the ability to save tasks. If you want to delete a task, you clear thre task box and press save.
